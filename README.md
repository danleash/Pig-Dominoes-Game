# Pig-Dominoes-Game
Dominoes game web application in JavaScript.
Rules:

1. Object of game is to reach 100 by clicking the roll dice button.
2. If you roll a 1 it is the other players turn to roll and you have no points added to your score. 
3. You can hold and keep your points at any time, deffering to the other player.
4. First to 100 wins!

I used JavaScript to code this project, allowing dynamic changes to be made to my CSS-
producing a more dynamic and user-friendly flow to the application.
